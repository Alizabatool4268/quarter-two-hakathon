# Introduction
I developed this project during an intense 24-hour hackathon, where the main challenge was to replicate a given template using Next.js. Leveraging the power and flexibility of Next.js, I was able to successfully clone the design while ensuring the application remained fully static and highly optimized. The primary focus of this project was to showcase my design skills, emphasizing layout precision, responsiveness, and visual appeal rather than dynamic functionality. Despite the time constraints, I maintained a strong attention to detail and delivered a clean, professional-looking web app.

# What I Learned:
This experience taught me how to work effectively under pressure and manage my time efficiently. I also learned the importance of prioritizing tasks and focusing on delivering something I am truly passionate about, even in high-stress environments. It strengthened both my technical and mental resilience, which are crucial skills for real-world development challenges.
